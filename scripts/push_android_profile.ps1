.SYNOPSIS
    Copy a desktop DoubleSlash profile onto a connected Android device.

.DESCRIPTION
    Moves an existing identity (and optionally its peer, room and chat stores)
    into the Android app's private storage, so the phone comes up as the same
    peer your desktop already is.

    This is a MOVE, not a device link. The supernode keys relay connections,
    signaling senders and the endpoint mailbox by identity, so a second live
    connection with the same identity evicts the first - and room group keys are
    sealed per member identity to a single signaling target, so the losing
    device fails closed and sees nothing in rooms. Run one at a time.

    App-private storage is not writable by `adb push`, so each file goes to
    /data/local/tmp first and is copied in via `run-as`, which works because
    debug builds are debuggable. Release builds are not, and this will refuse.

.PARAMETER ProfileDir
    Desktop profile to copy from. Defaults to ~/.doubleslash, or ~/.conquerd
    if that profile still exists.

.PARAMETER IdentityOnly
    Copy only identity.dat, leaving the phone with empty peer/room/chat stores.
    The identity is the same, so trusted peers still recognise you - you just
    start with no local history.

.PARAMETER Serial
    Target a specific device when more than one is attached (adb -s).

    ./scripts/push_android_profile.ps1
    ./scripts/push_android_profile.ps1 -IdentityOnly
