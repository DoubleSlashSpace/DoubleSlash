    Desktop-side checks, read from the profile the real app uses.

    The log assertions read .clientA/logs/doubleslash-client.log - the same file
    run_client.bat writes - so they describe the client you actually ran rather
    than a synthetic one.

    The driven scenario at the end is opt-in (-IncludeDesktopScenario) because
    it starts a headless client against that same profile, and two clients
    sharing one identity fight over the log and the QUIC listener port.
