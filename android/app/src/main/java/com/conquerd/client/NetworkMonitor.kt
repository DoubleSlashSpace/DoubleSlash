/**
 * Tells the core when the device moves between networks.
 *
 * A phone that walks off Wi-Fi onto cellular leaves every open socket bound to
 * a local address that no longer exists, and TCP does not report that: the
 * connection neither errors nor delivers. The core has a liveness deadline for
 * exactly this case, but it can only be generous — a supernode is allowed to be
 * quiet — so left to itself the client is offline for a minute and a half after
 * every network change. Android knows the moment it happens, so it says so and
 * the core re-dials immediately.
 *
 * Only a change of the *default* network counts. Capability and link-property
 * callbacks fire constantly — signal strength, metered flags, DNS updates — and
 * none of them invalidate a socket.
