/**
 * Output routing for voice sessions (calls and room voice).
 *
 * Android decides where a stream plays from its `AudioAttributes.usage`, not
 * from anything the app asks for afterwards. The native core opens its Oboe
 * streams with `Usage::VoiceCommunication` (see the vendored cpal fork in
 * `rust/patches/cpal`); this class owns the other half — putting the device in
 * `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` and selecting which endpoint that call route lands
 * on. Without *both*, a stream stays on the media route: always the
 * loudspeaker, never the earpiece, and with no platform echo canceller
 * attached to capture.
 *
 * Routing is only meaningful while a session is live, so [activate] and
 * [release] bracket it and the mode is restored on the way out — leaving the
 * device in `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` would duck every other app's audio.
