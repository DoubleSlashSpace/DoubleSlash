/**
 * Covers the peer dot's two independent sources.
 *
 * The bug this replaced was a peer dot that meant "do I have a direct QUIC
 * session" rather than "is this peer up": remote on cellular, a pair behind
 * CGNAT never gets a direct session, so chat flowed over the relay while the
 * list showed the peer offline. These assert the union that fixed it, and in
 * particular that losing one source does not clear a peer the other still
 * vouches for.
