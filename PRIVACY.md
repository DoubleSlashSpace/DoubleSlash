# DoubleSlash Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-09-10

This file is the privacy policy for the DoubleSlash **desktop** and **Android**
clients. The public URL for store listings and in-app links is
[github.com/DoubleSlashSpace/DoubleSlash/blob/develop/PRIVACY.md](https://github.com/DoubleSlashSpace/DoubleSlash/blob/develop/PRIVACY.md).

DoubleSlash is a local-first, invite-only peer-to-peer application. Voice, video,
chat, and file transfer travel directly between clients you connect to, or
through volunteer supernodes you explicitly choose to trust. Application
payloads are encrypted on the wire; supernodes relay signed/encrypted frames and
cannot read message, audio, or video content. DoubleSlash does not operate any
central servers that store your identity, messages, or call data.

There is no DoubleSlash account. Deleting the app, or purging local history in
Settings, removes what this device holds. There is no server copy to request.

---

## Information stored on your device

All persistent DoubleSlash data is written under `DOUBLESLASH_HOME`
(default `~/.doubleslash/` on Linux/macOS). This data
does not leave your device unless you explicitly connect to a peer or
supernode and exchange it as part of normal operation, or you initiate an
optional feature described below (updates, link previews, Ollama, and so on).

| File / location | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `identity.dat` | Your Ed25519 identity (v2, AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest) |
| `identity.json` | Legacy v1 plaintext identity (read-only after migration, if present) |
| `peers.dat` | Trusted-peer records (encrypted): public keys, handles, relay hints, block state, optional avatar config, build-attestation metadata |
| `chat_history.db` | Local chat history; message bodies and sender handles are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest |
| `settings.json` | App preferences (audio, video/capture choices, plugins, privacy toggles, window size, etc.) |
| `my_rooms.dat` | Saved room invites (encrypted) |
| OS keyring (`doubleslash` service) | Optional cached AES unlock key so you are not prompted for your passphrase every launch |
| OS **Downloads** folder | Files received from peers (saved by the desktop client on completion) |
| `installer.log` | Installer/updater activity log (written when `doubleslash-installer` runs) |

The desktop client logs to **stderr** via Rust `tracing` (controlled by the
`RUST_LOG` environment variable). It does not write a persistent client log file
by default.

### Android

On Android the same encrypted stores live in **app-private storage**
(`filesDir/doubleslash/`), not under `~/.doubleslash/`. Other apps cannot read
that directory. Cloud backup is turned off (`allowBackup="false"`) so a
device backup cannot copy the identity key or chat database off the phone.

| Location | What it contains |
|---|---|
| App-private `doubleslash/` | `identity.dat`, `peers.dat`, `chat_history.db`, `my_rooms.dat` — same encrypted formats as desktop |
| Android Keystore + app-private preferences | Optional “stay unlocked” wrapping of the identity *file key* (never the passphrase). Off until you turn it on. A copy of that wrapped blob is useless without this device’s Keystore key. |
| App cache (`cacheDir/outbound`) | Temporary copies of files you chose to send, because a Storage Access Framework `content://` URI is not a path the transfer can stream from |
| App-private received files | Downloads stay in app storage until you export them with the system document picker |
| Logcat (`DoubleSlash` tag) | Diagnostic logs on a USB-debuggable build. Not a persistent file. |

Android does **not** run the desktop GitHub update checker or UPnP mapper.

### User-created backups and restored profiles

The **Devices & Backups** wizard exports an encrypted `.dbackup` file only when
you request it. The file contains identity recovery material, saved peer trust
and blocks, rooms and Space trees (including hidden rooms), chat history, and
preferences. Available files referenced by chat history are included by default;
you can turn attachment inclusion off. The completion report counts missing files.
The backup password protects the entire archive, including metadata. Anyone with
both the file and its password can recover the identity and read its saved data.
There is no password-reset service.

The destination is chosen with the platform file picker. If you choose a cloud
document provider on Android, that provider receives the encrypted backup file.
Android uses a temporary encrypted copy in app cache during import/export. While
verifying an import, the app extracts its data into a private staging directory;
attachment contents there have the same protection as ordinary received files.
Normal cancellation and failed verification remove staging data. A process or
device crash can leave a private staging directory behind.

Successful imports are stored in `profiles/<random-id>/` beneath the profile
collection root. `active-profile` selects the profile to load; existing profiles
are preserved. Restore sets a new local unlock passphrase and does not copy
keyring/Keystore entries, OS permission grants, or native plugin binaries. Camera
sharing and capture-source selections are reset. A backup is a snapshot, not a
live sync or a revocable device credential; deleting or replacing it elsewhere
does not revoke an already copied identity.

No telemetry, analytics, advertising ID, or usage reporting is collected by
DoubleSlash on any platform.

## Information transmitted automatically

The following network contacts can occur without an extra confirmation step
beyond normal app use. No account credentials, message content, or contact lists
are sent in these paths.

### Update check (GitHub Releases API) — desktop only

**What:** When *Check for updates automatically* is enabled (the default), the
desktop client polls the GitHub Releases API at startup and once per hour while
the app remains open to see whether a newer version is available. The Android
client does not do this.

**Endpoint:** `https://api.github.com/repos/DoubleSlashSpace/DoubleSlash/releases/latest`

**What is disclosed:** Your IP address is visible to GitHub (Microsoft Corp.) as
part of the HTTPS request. The client sends `User-Agent:
doubleslash-client/{version}` (for example `doubleslash-client/1.0.0`) and accepts
`application/vnd.github+json`. GitHub may log this alongside your IP. No
personal information beyond what any HTTPS request carries is sent.

**Settings note:** The preference is persisted as `update_check_enabled` in
`settings.json` and takes effect immediately. Turning it off prevents both the
startup request and subsequent hourly checks. It does not hide an update that
was already discovered or prevent you from applying that update manually.

**How to limit:** Turn off *Check for updates automatically* in Settings. You
can additionally block outbound HTTPS to `api.github.com`. When you choose to
apply an update, `doubleslash-installer` downloads release archives, checksums, and
(when published) `releases_manifest.json` from GitHub.

### UPnP port mapping — desktop only

**What:** When *Enable UPnP port mapping* is on (the default), DoubleSlash sends
SSDP discovery multicast on your **local area network** to locate a UPnP-capable
router and requests a temporary port-forwarding rule. This can improve direct
peer-to-peer reachability without a relay. The Android client does not use UPnP.

**Servers contacted:** No external Internet servers are contacted. UPnP traffic
stays on your LAN (multicast to `239.255.255.250`). Only your router responds.

**What is disclosed:** Your internal IP address and the port DoubleSlash is
listening on are sent to your local router. Nothing leaves your network.

**How to disable:** Uncheck *Enable UPnP port mapping* in Settings, or set
`upnp_enabled` to `false` in `settings.json`. DoubleSlash falls back to direct
QUIC/WebSocket candidates and supernode relay when needed.

---

## Information transmitted when you opt in or take an action

### Camera, screen, and shared-audio capture

**What:** Nothing is captured until you start it. Turning your camera on in a
call, opening the local preview in **Settings → Video**, or choosing a source
from the **Share video** control starts capture; stopping the share or the call
ends it. DoubleSlash does not capture in the background and does not capture
while idle.

Three kinds of source can be captured, and they differ in how much they expose:

| Source | Platforms | What it captures |
|---|---|---|
| Camera | Windows, Linux, macOS, Android | The camera device you select |
| Microphone (voice) | All platforms | The microphone only while a call or room voice session is active |
| Screen or single window | **Windows only** (`Windows.Graphics.Capture`) | Everything visible on the chosen monitor, or the contents of the chosen window |
| Audio shared with a video | **Windows only** (WASAPI loopback) | Either *all* sound this machine plays, or the sound of one application's process tree |

On **Android**, a call that you have answered or placed keeps the microphone
(and camera, if you turned video on) while the screen is off or another app is
in front. A persistent notification (“DoubleSlash is connected” / “call in
progress”) is shown for as long as that is true. Disconnect from the
notification, or lock the identity in the app, to stop it. DoubleSlash does
not capture when you are not in a call.

**Two things worth knowing before you share:**

- **Sharing a whole screen shares everything on it** — notifications, other
  windows you switch to, and anything that pops up while the share is running.
- **Whole-machine audio capture picks up every sound the machine plays**,
  including notification chimes and audio from another call. Per-application
  capture is narrower, but it requires Windows 10 build 20348 or later; on older
  builds DoubleSlash **falls back to whole-machine audio** rather than sharing
  nothing. If you are on an older Windows build and picked a single application,
  assume system audio is what your peers hear.

**Where it goes:** only to the peers in that call. Direct 1:1 media travels over
your authenticated QUIC session to that peer. Room media is end-to-end sealed
under the per-room sender key before it leaves your machine, so a supernode
forwards opaque bytes it cannot decode. A supernode can see that a stream is
flowing, its byte volume, and whether your camera is on or off — never the
picture or the sound.

**What is not done with it:** captured video and audio are not recorded, not
written to disk, and not sent to any DoubleSlash service (there are none). Device
enumeration for the settings list and the local preview stay on your machine.

**How to disable:** turn the camera off, stop the share, or simply never start
one. Which audio accompanies a share is chosen when the share starts and is also
settable in **Settings → Video** (`content_audio_mode` in `settings.json`):
`auto` follows the source (an application shares its own audio, a monitor shares
the machine, a camera shares nothing), `system` always shares the whole machine,
and `off` never shares audio at all.

### Inline link / video previews in chat

**What:** When *Show YouTube preview cards in chat* is enabled (default: on),
messages containing YouTube, Vimeo, or direct video URLs show a local preview
card in the chat UI. Expanding the inline player (after the first-time
acknowledgement, if shown) loads the embed in an embedded Chromium view
(Qt WebEngine).

**Servers contacted (only after you expand inline playback or open the link):**
YouTube (`youtube.com`, `googlevideo.com`, `ytimg.com`, …), Vimeo
(`vimeo.com`, `player.vimeo.com`, …), or the direct video host. DoubleSlash does
**not** use `yt-dlp` for this feature.

**What is disclosed:** The video host sees a normal browser/embed request from
your IP. No chat message text is sent to DoubleSlash-operated servers (there are
none).

**How to disable:** Uncheck *Show YouTube preview cards in chat* in Settings
(`youtube_preview_enabled` in `settings.json`). Opening links with *Open* still
launches your system browser.

### Ollama AI assistant (optional plugin)

**What:** When *Enable AI assistant* is on, DoubleSlash sends HTTP requests to the
Ollama base URL you configure (default `http://localhost:11434`) to list
installed models (`/api/tags`), see which are currently loaded (`/api/ps`),
and stream completions. Chat text you route to the assistant is included in
those local requests.

**Servers contacted:** Only the Ollama instance you configure — by default your
own machine. No DoubleSlash cloud service is involved.

**Peer visibility:** The `x.ollama.v1` capability may be advertised to
connected peers as a presence signal; message content is not sent to peers
through the plugin. If *Allow assistant to control this client* is on
(`ollama_tools_enabled`), the local model can drive this client (send chat,
join rooms, start or answer calls). Those actions are ordinary client
traffic and are visible to the peers they target. Tool results stay local
to Ollama. If *Speak in voice sessions* is on (`ollama_voice_enabled`),
auto-replies are synthesised with the Windows speech engine and sent as
ordinary call audio. If `ollama_stt_model` is set, decoded remote voice is
sent to your local Ollama URL for transcription — not to any other host.
Inbound chat image attachments may be base64-encoded and sent to that same
local Ollama instance when auto-reply or `view_image` runs, so a vision
model can see them. If *Let the assistant send files* is on
(`ollama_file_sharing_enabled`, off by default), the model can send peers and
rooms any attachment already in this profile's chat history, from any
conversation, and any file in the folder you pick (`ollama_share_folder`,
including up to four levels of subfolders). Anyone who can chat with the
assistant can ask it for those files, so share a folder that holds only what
you are willing to give them. The file names in that folder are sent to your
local Ollama instance when the model lists them. Paths that lead outside the
folder are refused, and so is a folder that contains, or sits inside, the
DoubleSlash profile.

**How to disable:** Turn off *Enable AI assistant* in Settings
(`ollama_enabled` in `settings.json`). Turn off *Allow assistant to control
this client* to keep auto-reply text-only, or just *Let the assistant send
files* to stop it sending files. Restored backups strip the auto-respond,
tools, and file-sharing settings, including the shared folder.

### Supernode portal and gated relay pages

**What:** When you connect to a supernode that exposes a portal or access gate,
DoubleSlash may load operator-hosted pages inside the embedded browser (typically
`d://` over the QUIC portal, or HTTPS where configured). External links
from those pages open in your system browser.

**Servers contacted:** The supernode operator you chose — not DoubleSlash.

**What is disclosed:** The operator can see that you visited their portal and
your IP address for any HTTPS content they host. Portal traffic over
`d://` is carried on your authenticated QUIC session to that supernode.

On Android the portal runs in the system WebView with JavaScript enabled for
the `window.doubleslash` bridge. File and content-provider access are disabled.
The page is fetched over the same authenticated QUIC session as desktop.

### Android connection notification

**What:** While the Android identity is unlocked, a foreground-service
notification stays in the status bar so the process can hold peer sessions
when the screen is off. There is no central push server; without this, the
phone would drop the session when you leave the app.

**How to stop:** tap **Disconnect** on the notification, or lock the identity
in the app. The notification is not shown while the app is locked.

**Permissions used:** `INTERNET`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (the connection notice),
`RECORD_AUDIO` and `CAMERA` only when you start a call or turn video on. Files
use the system document picker; DoubleSlash does not request broad photo or
storage access.

### Build attestation between peers

**What:** After connecting, peers may exchange signed build-attestation
metadata (version string, reproducible build id, source hash) so each side can
show whether the other appears to be running an official release. This is
governed by the *Attestation policy* setting (`off` / `warn` / `strict`).

**What is disclosed:** Build metadata only — not message or audio content.

## Peer-to-peer communication

Direct connections and supernode relays expose your **IP address** to the
peer or operator on the other end of that path. That is how packet networks
work; DoubleSlash has no first-party server that could hide it. Handles,
public keys, and whatever you send are also visible to the people you chose
to invite.

When you connect to a peer, the following data is transmitted over encrypted
signaling and session channels:

- Your display name (chosen during onboarding)
- Your long-term Ed25519 public key (your identity)
- Messages, voice audio, and files you explicitly send
- Video and shared audio while you are sharing (see *Camera, screen, and
  shared-audio capture* above)
- Optional `AvatarConfig` after handshake (trusted peers only)
- Negotiated capability descriptors (`CAPABILITY_ANNOUNCE`)

If you choose **Invite to trusted peers** on a room member, that member receives
an ordinary personal invite from you: your display name, public key, and, when
known, your local-network QUIC address. It is encrypted to them before it
reaches the supernode. The supernode can see that you sent them an encrypted
message, but not what it contains. Nothing is sent unless you choose the
action, and neither of you trusts the other until they accept.

When you use a volunteer **supernode** for relay or group voice:

- The supernode forwards encrypted/signed payloads between peers but **cannot
  decrypt** application content — it has no access to your identity key material
  or session keys.
- The operator can observe connection/relay activity and approximate traffic
  volumes, but not message or audio content.

Supernodes are configured by you and run by peers or operators you choose to
trust. DoubleSlash does not operate any supernodes.

## Third-party components

DoubleSlash bundles the following open-source components. They do not phone home
on their own; external contact happens only through the behaviors described
above.

| Component | Purpose | External contacts |
|---|---|---|
| [Qt 6 / CXX-Qt](https://www.qt.io/privacy-policy) | Desktop UI | None from Qt itself |
| [Qt WebEngine](https://www.qt.io/privacy-policy) | Inline previews, supernode portal | Only when you load external or embed URLs (see above) |
| [quinn](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn) | QUIC transport | None |
| [libopus](https://opus-codec.org/) (vendored, `doubleslash-opus`) | Voice and shared-audio codec | None |
| [libvpx](https://www.webmproject.org/) (vendored, `doubleslash-vpx`) | VP8 and VP9 video codecs on every platform | None |
| OS media APIs (Media Foundation, `Windows.Graphics.Capture`, WASAPI, V4L2, AVFoundation, CameraX, Oboe) | Camera / screen / audio capture and H.264 encode | None — local device access only |
| [egui / eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui) | Installer UI | None |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (user-installed, optional) | Local AI backend | Only the URL you configure |
| AndroidX / Jetpack Compose / CameraX | Android UI and camera | None from these libraries |

## Deleting data

There is no DoubleSlash cloud account. To remove data on a device:

- **Desktop:** Settings → Privacy (trim or purge stored messages). Deleting the
  profile directory (`~/.doubleslash/`) removes identity,
  peers, rooms, and history. Clearing the OS keyring entry forgets the cached
  unlock key.
- **Android:** Settings can purge chat history. Uninstalling the app deletes
  app-private storage, including identity. Turning off “stay unlocked” deletes
  the Keystore wrapping key and the sealed blob. Disconnect or lock ends the
  live session without wiping stores.

Peers who already received a message, file, or call still have their own copy.
A revoke of a room file offer stops further downloads; bytes already delivered
cannot be un-sent.

---

## Children's privacy

DoubleSlash is not directed at children under 13. It does not knowingly collect
personal information from children.

---

## Changes to this policy

Material changes will be noted in the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/DoubleSlashSpace/DoubleSlash/releases) (and the README
"Release Notes" section) and this file updated with a new effective date.
