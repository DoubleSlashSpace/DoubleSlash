# supernode-manager

A standalone Rust CLI + TUI for deploying and operating fleets of `conquerd-supernode` instances over SSH. It lives at `rust/conquerd-supernode-manager/` in the DoubleSlash repository, in its own Cargo workspace; it is independent of the application crates but targets the same supernode release artifacts.

> **Status (v0.1.0):** Production-tested. Linux remote hosts with systemd are supported end-to-end; cluster provisioning is operational (acdc a/b/c three-node cluster used for live integration testing). Default entry point is an interactive TUI; all operations are also available as CLI subcommands. Remote targets are **Linux + systemd only** — no launchd or Windows-service backends yet.

---

## 1. Goal

Let one operator, from a laptop, manage many supernodes:

- **Multiple instances on a single machine** (different ports + isolated data dirs).
- **Many machines** (VPS, bare metal, ARM) reached over plain SSH.
- A declarative `inventory.toml` plus commands for install, lifecycle, status, logs, config push, invite, and uninstall.
- No agent pre-installed on hosts: bootstrap everything over SSH.

**Non-goals:** not a ConquerD backend, identity authority, or discovery service. Only provisions and supervises the supernode process. Does not weaken the client-only, invite-only trust model — operates below ConquerD at the OS/process layer.

---

## 2. What a supernode needs to run (host contract)

Derived from `rust/conquerd-supernode` in the DoubleSlash repo (`config.rs`, `manifest.rs`, `main.rs`) and `docs/SUPERNODE.md`. The manager must honor this contract; it does not import DoubleSlash application crates.

### Binary

- Executable: `conquerd-supernode` (`.exe` on Windows builds).
- Distributed via GitHub Releases (`ConquerD/ConquerD`, overridable via `defaults.release_repo` or `SNM_SUPERNODE_RELEASE_REPO`):
  - **Linux:** `conquerd-supernode-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz` + `.sha256`
  - **Windows x86_64:** `conquerd-supernode-<version>-win64.zip` + `.sha256` (zip extraction **not implemented** in the manager yet)
- Supported release platforms: `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, `win64` (Linux only for remote install today).
- On the host the manager stages `{install_root}/bin/conquerd-supernode-{version}` and symlinks `{install_root}/bin/current` → that file.
- `defaults.version` may be a release tag (`1.0.0`, `nightly`), or `"local"` with `defaults.binary_path` pointing at a local binary on the operator machine.

### Data directory (per instance, isolated)

Resolved from `CONQUERD_HOME` (manager sets this per instance). Default layout: `{data_root}/{instance_id}` e.g. `/var/lib/conquerd/a`.

| File / dir | Purpose | Manager concern |
|---|---|---|
| `supernode.toml` | Typed feature manifest (`schema_version = 1`) | Manager renders and pushes via `install` / `config-push` |
| `identity.json` | Ed25519 node identity (first run) | **Persistent — never clobber** |
| `peers.json` | Known peers | Persistent |
| `supernode_endpoints.json` | Endpoint mailbox | Persistent |
| `reusable_invite.json` | Invite payload | Read by `invite` command |
| `web/`, `games/<slug>/` | In-app portal assets | Seeded by supernode binary; not synced by manager yet |
| `trusted_module_keys.txt` | Plugin signer keys | Not pushed by manager yet |

There is deliberately no `sfu_rooms.json`: room definitions are encrypted, client-owned state, while supernodes host SFU rooms in memory and idle-GC them. The manager must never add room persistence to a supernode deployment.

### Configuration surface

- **Preferred:** `<data_dir>/supernode.toml` — manager generates per instance via `snm-supernode::manifest::render_supernode_toml`.
- **SFU room policy:** `[defaults.supernode]` / per-instance overrides for `allow_public_rooms` / `allow_private_rooms` are emitted as **inline** `params = { … }` on the `room.audio.sfu` feature row (not a separate `[feature.params]` table).
- **Legacy env vars** (still written in systemd drop-ins): `supernode_host`, `supernode_port`, `supernode_signaling_port`. Manifest fields (`listen_addr`, `ws_listen_addr`) are authoritative in `supernode.toml`. The in-app portal uses QUIC (`web.host.app.v1`) — no public HTTP port.
- **Current runtime limitation:** the manager also serializes `identity_file` and `access_mode`, but `conquerd-supernode::manifest::apply_to_config` does not currently apply either field. The runtime always loads `<data_dir>/identity.json`, and access control comes from `supernode_access_mode` plus its related environment variables. The generated systemd drop-in does not set those access variables, so manager inventory values other than the default open mode are descriptive only until that implementation gap is closed. Do not rely on them to enforce a gate.
- **Clustering:** an optional `[cluster]` section (with `[[cluster.member]]` rows) links several supernodes into one logical node. Additive to `schema_version = 1` — the manager renders and pushes the shared roster to every member. Full contract, provisioning flow, and firewalling in §8.
- `CONQUERD_BUILD_ID` is compiled into the binary; status probes it via `strings` when present.

### Ports per instance

Each instance binds at minimum:

- QUIC relay (UDP): default `3478 + 100×index`
- WS signaling (TCP): default `34935 + 100×index`
- **Cluster QUIC link (UDP): only when the instance is part of a cluster** — a dedicated port distinct from the relay port, set via `cluster_addr`. Suggested default `4478 + 100×index` (relay + 1000). Reachable **between cluster members only**, not the public. See §8.

There is **no** public web/game port. The in-app portal is served over the peer's existing QUIC session (`web.host.app.v1`).

Omitted relay/ws/cluster ports in inventory are auto-allocated at resolve time (`snm-core::inventory::default_*_port`). They are **not** written back into `inventory.toml` automatically — pin ports explicitly for stability.

`public_host` on each instance must be the address remote clients use for relay tickets.

### Process lifecycle

- No hot-reload; config/binary changes need a **restart** (`config-push` restarts by default; `--no-restart` to skip).
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM.
- Supervisor: systemd templated unit `conquerd-supernode@.service` + per-instance drop-in under `conquerd-supernode@{id}.service.d/override.conf`.

### Health / observability

Status today comes from `systemctl is-active`, binary identity probe (SHA-256 + mtime + optional embedded build id), and `journalctl`. There is no public HTTP health endpoint (portal is in-app over QUIC).

    end
```

- **Control plane:** operator machine. Holds inventory + SSH credentials. Stateless beyond local config and a release download cache under the system temp dir.
- **Transport:** SSH (port 22). Two backends behind `SshTransport` (see §4).
- **Per host:** one or more instances — shared versioned binary, separate data dir, systemd unit instance, relay/WS ports, and an additional cluster port when clustered.

**Crate layout:**

```
rust/conquerd-supernode-manager/
  Cargo.toml                 # workspace
  inventory.toml             # operator fleet definition (not committed secrets)
  launch.ps1                 # Windows launcher: loads SSH credentials, runs TUI/CLI
  crates/
    snm-cli/                 # clap binary `supernode-manager` + ratatui TUI
    snm-core/                # inventory model, selector, supernode config resolution
    snm-transport/           # Transport trait; embedded (russh) + openssh backends
    snm-supernode/           # install/ops, manifest render, systemd, release download,
                             #   firewall (ufw), invite, binary identity probe
```

---

## 4. SSH transport

Both backends are implemented behind `snm_transport::SshTransport`:

| Backend | Flag / env | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Embedded** (default) | `--ssh-backend embedded` | Pure Rust (`russh` + `russh-sftp`). Reads `~/.ssh` keys; falls back to `SNM_SSH_PASSWORD[_<HOST>]`, then interactive keyboard-interactive. Host keys via `known_hosts`. |
| **OpenSSH** | `--ssh-backend openssh` | Wraps system `ssh`/`scp`; honors `~/.ssh/config`, agent, jump hosts. |

`SNM_SSH_BACKEND=openssh` also selects OpenSSH. On Windows, `launch.ps1` loads `secrets.local.ps1` for password auth.

Credentials are resolved per host. `SNM_SSH_PASSWORD_<HOST>` and `SNM_SSH_USER_<HOST>` — where `<HOST>` is the `[[host]].name` from `inventory.toml`, uppercased with non-alphanumerics as `_` — take precedence over the bare `SNM_SSH_PASSWORD` / `SNM_SSH_USER`. `SNM_SSH_USER_<HOST>` also overrides the `user@` in that host's `ssh` string; the bare `SNM_SSH_USER` only fills in when there is none. Typed passwords are cached per `user@host:port` for the process, never shared across hosts. Only the user override reaches the OpenSSH backend — it delegates auth to the system `ssh` client.

Capabilities used today: remote command + exit code, upload bytes/files (SFTP or scp), no streaming log follow over SSH in TUI (fetches journal snapshot).

---

## 5. Inventory model

Declarative TOML; edited by hand or via the TUI (add/edit nodes, settings panel).

```toml
[defaults]
version = "nightly"              # or "1.0.0", "local"
access_mode = "open"
user = "conquerd"
install_root = "/opt/conquerd"
data_root = "/var/lib/conquerd"
release_repo = "ConquerD/ConquerD"
privilege = "root"               # sudo | root | rootless-systemd (last: not implemented)
firewall = "ufw"                 # ufw | off | report
# binary_path = "..."            # required when version = "local"

[defaults.supernode]
listen_bind = "0.0.0.0"
identity_file = "identity.json"
allow_public_rooms = false
allow_private_rooms = true

[[host]]
name = "acdc"
ssh = "root@155.138.244.189"
# arch = "linux-x86_64"          # optional; auto-detected via ping

  [[host.instance]]
  id = "a"
  public_host = "155.138.244.189"
  relay_port = 3478
  ws_port = 34935
  features = ["core.chat.v1", "room.audio.sfu", "web.host.app.v1", "game.relay.v1", ...]
```

Rules:

- `(host.name, instance.id)` is the unique deployment key.
- `[[host.instance]]` in TOML deserializes to `host.instances` in Rust.
- Effective per-instance overrides: `listen_bind`, `allow_public_rooms`, and `allow_private_rooms`. The schema also accepts `access_mode` and `identity_file`, but the current supernode runtime does not apply those generated manifest fields; see the runtime limitation in §2.
- Features accept bare strings or `{ id, enabled, params }` objects.
- `init` scaffolds `inventory.toml` and a `secrets.toml` template; live SSH passwords typically live in gitignored `secrets.local.ps1` on Windows.

**Clusters (implemented model, §8):** group instances that should act as one logical supernode.

```toml
[[cluster]]
id = "acme-us"                              # becomes cluster_id in every member's supernode.toml
members = ["acdc/a", "acdc/b", "west/a"]    # host/instance keys
cluster_port = 4478                         # base UDP port; per-instance offset like other ports
```

The manager resolves each member's `relay_addr` / `cluster_addr` / `ws_addr` from its `public_host` + port set, and its `identity_pub` (collected after first run — see §8), then renders the shared roster into every member.

---

## 6. Command surface (implemented)

```
supernode-manager [global options] [subcommand]

Global:
  --inventory <path>     default: inventory.toml (also searched upward from exe)
  --ssh-backend <embedded|openssh>

  (no subcommand)        → TUI fleet dashboard (default)

  init [--force]
  connect [--host …] [--instance …] [--all]
  ping    [--host …] [--instance …] [--all]
  install [--host …] [--instance …] [--all] [--allow-decluster]
  config-push [--host …] [--instance …] [--all] [--no-restart] [--allow-decluster]
  start | stop | restart
  status  [--host …] [--instance …] [--all]
  logs    [--host …] [--instance …] [--all] [-f] [-n lines]
  invite  [--host …] [--instance …] [--all]
  exec    [--host …] [--instance …] <remote shell command>
  remove  [--host …] [--instance …] [--yes]   # local inventory only
  uninstall [--host …] [--instance …] [--purge] [--yes]
  cluster-sync [--cluster <id>]
  build-deploy [--host …] [--instance …] [--all] --source <package-dir>
               [--target <triple>] [--build-tool <cargo|zigbuild|cross>]
               [--allow-decluster]
  tui
```

**TUI** (ratatui): fleet table, node add/edit, per-node supernode config editor (features + SFU policy), settings (version/repo/privilege/firewall/build source), install/start/stop/restart, build and deploy, cluster sync, config push, logs viewer, invite copy, uninstall with purge confirmation, auto-refresh.

`build-deploy` requires `--source` in CLI mode even when `defaults.build_source` is configured; the TUI reads `defaults.build_source` directly.

**Not implemented yet:** `plan` (dry-run diff), dedicated `update` (stage + symlink flip + health check + rollback), signed `releases_manifest.json` verification, audit log, HTTP metrics scrape.

---

## 7. Multi-instance on one machine

Each instance is independent:

| Concern | Layout |
|---|---|
| Data dir | `{data_root}/{instance_id}` via `CONQUERD_HOME` in systemd drop-in |
| Binary | Shared `{install_root}/bin/conquerd-supernode-{version}` + `current` symlink |
| Unit | `conquerd-supernode@{id}.service` from template `conquerd-supernode@.service` |
| Drop-in | `/etc/systemd/system/conquerd-supernode@{id}.service.d/override.conf` — `CONQUERD_HOME`, `supernode_host`, legacy port env vars |
| Manifest | `{data_root}/{id}/supernode.toml` — listen addresses, features, and optional cluster roster; generated access/identity fields are currently not applied by the runtime (see §2) |

Install flow (`snm-supernode::ops::install_instance`): ensure service user + dirs → upload binary → symlink `current` → push `supernode.toml` → push unit template + drop-in → `daemon-reload` → optional ufw rules → `enable` + `start`.

Uninstall: stop/disable → remove drop-in → optional `--purge` of data dir → remove tagged ufw rules. Does not remove the shared unit template or binary.

**Privilege modes:** `sudo` and `root` work. `rootless-systemd` is recognized in inventory/TUI but install/uninstall bail with "not implemented".

**Firewall:** `firewall = "ufw"` adds idempotent tagged `ufw allow` rules on install and removes them on uninstall. `report` prints required ports only. `off` skips mutation.

---

## 8. Clustering — logical supernodes

> **Supernode side: implemented** (`conquerd-supernode` `cluster.rs` / `cluster_link.rs`; client failover in `connection_manager`). **Manager side: implemented** — `cluster-sync` collects identities, renders the shared roster into every member's `supernode.toml`, applies restricted cluster-port firewall rules, and restarts members. See §6 for the CLI and §13 for the testing workflow.

Several supernodes can be **linked into a cluster** that presents as one logical supernode to clients. A client attaches to any member; members replicate room chat/audio, durable **room existence** (`RoomRoster`), Space roots, and client trust (`PeerAuth`) over a dedicated supernode↔supernode QUIC mesh — **not** per-peer private-room ACLs (cold-node admit is Space proof / local token rematerialize / creator self-admit). A client transparently **fails over to a sibling** if its member goes down. Members never see plaintext — clustering is a fan-out/replication fabric, **not** a trust escalation. One cluster hosts a given room; cross-operator sharing means linking those operators' supernodes into one cluster (there is no inter-cluster federation).

### `[cluster]` manifest section

The manager renders this into **every** member's `supernode.toml` (additive to `schema_version = 1`; older builds ignore it):

```toml
[cluster]
cluster_id = "acme-us"                    # shared by every member

[[cluster.member]]
identity_pub = "BASE64URL_ED25519"        # the member node's public_id
relay_addr   = "node-a.example:3478"      # client relay attach point
cluster_addr = "node-a.example:4478"      # dedicated supernode↔supernode QUIC link
ws_addr      = "node-a.example:34935"     # client signaling / failover attach point

[[cluster.member]]
identity_pub = "..."
relay_addr   = "node-b.example:3478"
cluster_addr = "node-b.example:4478"
ws_addr      = "node-b.example:34935"
```

- Every member lists the **full roster, including itself**; the list is identical on every member.
- A member whose own identity is **absent** from the roster logs a warning and **runs standalone** (fail-safe) — the manager must include each node in its own copy.
- `cluster_addr` is a **new dedicated UDP/QUIC port** (see §2), separate from `relay_addr`. A member without a `cluster_addr` cannot be dialed for replication.
- Members authenticate each other's links by cert CN against the roster and require every cluster message to be Ed25519-signed, so a spoofed identity cannot inject replication.
- The roster is signed by each member and advertised to clients in `SUPERNODE_INFO`; clients verify the signature against the supernode they already trust before using siblings for failover.

### Identity-first provisioning (two-phase)

The roster needs each member's `identity_pub`, which only exists **after** the node's first run generates `identity.json`. Cluster provisioning is therefore two-phase:

1. **Install** every member instance normally (first run generates `identity.json` → `public_id`).
2. **Collect** each member's `public_id` by reading `identity.json`'s `public_key` over SSH (same mechanism the manager already uses to read `reusable_invite.json`).
3. **Render** the `[cluster]` roster — all members with `relay_addr` / `cluster_addr` / `ws_addr` resolved from each instance's `public_host` + ports — into **every** member's `supernode.toml`.
4. **`config-push`** (with restart) to all members.

Adding or removing a member re-renders and re-pushes the roster to the whole cluster (a restart is required — no hot reload).

### Firewall

The `cluster_addr` UDP port must be reachable **between cluster members only**, never the public. The manager's ufw integration should open the cluster port **restricted to the member source IPs** (not `0.0.0.0`), tagged like the other rules for clean uninstall. Client-facing relay and WS ports stay publicly open as today; there is no public web port.

`install` / `build-deploy` firewall cleanup must preserve `snm:<host>/<instance>:cluster` rules. Only `cluster-sync` refreshes those restricted rules; reinstalling client-facing relay/WS rules must not remove them. Match the instance tag with its trailing colon so `a` does not match `a1`. Uninstall still removes all rules for the instance.

### Manager work (complete)

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Cluster declaration in inventory | `[[cluster]]` id + members + `cluster_port` (see §5) |
| Cluster-port allocation | fourth port per instance; default `4478 + 100×index`, pin for stability |
| Identity collection | read `identity.json` `public_key` per member over SSH |
| Roster render into `supernode.toml` | shared `[cluster]` block pushed to every member |
| Re-push on membership change | `cluster-sync` re-renders + restarts fleet-wide |
| Restricted cluster-port firewall | ufw allows the cluster port from member IPs only |
| Cluster section preservation | `install` and `config-push` read and re-append the existing `[cluster]` block so binary updates never wipe the cluster config |

---

## 9. Binary version identity (status)

`status` and the TUI fleet table show more than the inventory pin so operators can compare builds across instances:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Inventory pin | `defaults.version` (`nightly`, `1.0.0`, …) |
| SHA-256 short | First 12 hex chars of running binary behind `bin/current` |
| Date suffix | Binary mtime `·MM-DD` |
| Build id | Optional `CONQUERD_BUILD_ID` / git sha from `strings` |

**Display format:** `nightly@878696fcec9e·06-14` (CLI `version_detail()` also prints `build=…`, `mtime=…`, `bin=…`).

Implementation: `snm-supernode::binary_probe` — remote `readlink`, `sha256sum`, `stat`, `strings`.

---

## 10. Release download and updates

**Implemented:**

- Resolve GitHub release URL from `version` + detected/normalized platform (`linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`).
- Download archive + `.sha256` sidecar; verify SHA-256 before extract.
- Cache extracted binary locally; upload on `install`.

**Partial / gaps:**

- Re-running `install` overwrites the versioned binary path and refreshes the `current` symlink — there is no separate `update` command with rollback.
- No Ed25519 verification against ConquerD `releases_manifest.json`.
- `version = "local"` skips download; operator must set `defaults.binary_path`.
- Windows `.zip` artifacts are rejected at extract time.

`identity.json` and other persistent state are never regenerated by install/config-push (manifest upload only touches `supernode.toml`).

---

## 11. Security considerations

- **SSH host-key verification** enabled for embedded backend (`known_hosts`); OpenSSH uses system `known_hosts`.
- **Secrets:** `SNM_SSH_PASSWORD[_<HOST>]` / `SNM_SSH_USER[_<HOST>]` via gitignored `secrets.local.ps1`; `secrets.toml` template for future access codes — not logged.
- **Least privilege:** dedicated service user created on install; `sudo`/`root` for unit installation.
- **Binary provenance:** SHA-256 sidecar verified on download; running binary SHA shown in status. Signed manifest verification not yet implemented.
- **Destructive actions:** TUI confirm dialogs for remove/uninstall/purge; CLI `--yes` to skip prompts.
- **No trust escalation into ConquerD:** manager never mints client identities or invites — only reads `reusable_invite.json` from the node data dir.
- **Cluster links:** supernode↔supernode QUIC authenticates peers by cert CN against the signed roster and requires Ed25519-signed cluster messages, so a spoofed identity cannot inject replication. The manager must firewall `cluster_addr` to member IPs only (§8) — it is a trusted, intra-cluster surface, not a public one.

---

## 12. Implementation status

| Area | State |

| Single + multi-instance Linux deploy | Done |
| Multi-host fleet | Done |
| TUI dashboard | Done (default entry) |
| Embedded + OpenSSH transport | Done |
| GitHub release fetch + sha256 | Done |
| `config-push` + SFU inline params | Done |
| Manager-generated `access_mode` / `identity_file` runtime application | Gap — fields are serialized but not applied by `conquerd-supernode` |
| ufw firewall tagging | Done |
| Binary identity in status/TUI | Done |
| Supernode clustering (chat/ACL/trust replication + client failover) | Done — supernode + client sides |
| Manager cluster provisioning (roster render, identity collection, cluster port + firewall, cluster section preservation across redeploys) | Done |
| `plan`, `update` + rollback | Not started |
| rootless systemd | Stub only |
| Signed manifest verify | Not started |

## 13. Operator quick reference (Windows)

```powershell
# Build
cargo build --release

# Launch TUI (loads password from secrets.local.ps1)
.\launch.ps1

# CLI examples
.\launch.ps1 status --host acdc --all
.\launch.ps1 config-push --host acdc --instance a
.\launch.ps1 invite --host acdc --instance b
.\launch.ps1 logs --host acdc --instance a -n 200
```

Compare `VERSION` column hashes after deploy — matching `@` suffix means the same binary bytes even when both pins read `nightly`.

---

## 13a. Testing real supernodes and clusters

The manager is the primary integration-testing tool for the DoubleSlash supernode. Use it to set up a live cluster, verify cluster state, and debug remotely without logging into VMs.

### Cluster bring-up

```powershell
# 1. Install all nodes (or build + deploy from source)
.\launch.ps1 install --host acdc --all         # download nightly
# or
.\launch.ps1 build-deploy --host acdc --all --source ..\conquerd-supernode    # compile local source

# 2. Provision cluster — collect identity keys, push shared roster, restart
.\launch.ps1 cluster-sync

# 3. Verify — each node should show 8 cluster-related lines
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance a "grep -c cluster /var/lib/conquerd/a/supernode.toml"
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance b "grep -c cluster /var/lib/conquerd/b/supernode.toml"
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance c "grep -c cluster /var/lib/conquerd/c/supernode.toml"
```

### Direct remote debugging via `exec`

`exec` runs an arbitrary shell command on the first matching instance over SSH and streams the output. Use it to inspect live state without an SSH session:

```powershell
# Read the live manifest
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance a "cat /var/lib/conquerd/a/supernode.toml"

# Check the web portal template is seeded
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance a "head -5 /var/lib/conquerd/a/web/index.html"

# Confirm identity
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance a "cat /var/lib/conquerd/a/identity.json | python3 -c 'import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d[\"public_key\"][:20])'"

# Tail recent logs
.\launch.ps1 logs --host acdc --instance a -n 100

# Check systemd unit status
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance a "systemctl status conquerd-supernode@a --no-pager"
```

### Workflow: redeploy without losing cluster config

`install` and `config-push` both preserve the existing `[cluster]` section when re-rendering `supernode.toml`. Only `cluster-sync` intentionally replaces the roster (with freshly collected identity keys). Safe redeploy sequence:

```powershell
# Build and redeploy — cluster section is preserved, service restarted
.\launch.ps1 build-deploy --host acdc --all --source ..\conquerd-supernode

# Spot-check cluster config survived
.\launch.ps1 exec --host acdc --instance a "grep cluster_id /var/lib/conquerd/a/supernode.toml"
```

If a manifest somehow loses the cluster section (e.g. manual edit), just re-run `cluster-sync` to restore it.

### Fetch invite for client testing

```powershell
.\launch.ps1 invite --host acdc --instance a
```

- Should auto-allocated ports be written back to `inventory.toml` or a sidecar lock file?
- Should `update` replace `install` for binary-only changes, or remain separate?
- macOS as a remote target (launchd) — needed?
- Firewall: keep ufw-only, or add firewalld/cloud SG reporting?
- Long-running reconciliation daemon vs strict invocation-based CLI?
