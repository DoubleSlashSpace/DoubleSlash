//! Capturing the audio a machine is *playing*, to send alongside video.
//!
//! Screen sharing a game or a video is close to useless silent, but the call
//! microphone is the wrong source for it: it would pick up the room, not the
//! application. What is wanted is the audio the OS is rendering — a loopback of
//! the output device.
//!
//! # Why this is not just "another input device"
//!
//! On every platform loopback is a distinct API rather than a device in the
//! normal capture list, which is why this does not reuse the CPAL path the mic
//! uses:
//!
//! * **Windows** — WASAPI, by two separate paths. Whole-machine audio opens the
//!   *render* endpoint with `AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_LOOPBACK`; one application's
//!   audio has no endpoint to open at all and goes through
//!   `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync` against a virtual device instead. Both are
//!   implemented here.
//! * **Linux** — PipeWire or a PulseAudio `.monitor` source. Unbuilt.
//! * **macOS** — no first-party loopback at all; needs a virtual device or
//!   ScreenCaptureKit's audio tap. Unbuilt, and the hardest of the three.
//!
//! # Timing
//!
//! Frames carry the offset the *device* reports, not a count of frames handed
//! out — see [`ContentFrame::offset_us`] and [`CaptureTimeline`]. This matters
//! far more for per-application capture than for whole-machine capture: one app
//! is silent most of the time, and a counting timeline would treat each of those
//! silences as though it had never happened.
//!
//! # Format contract
//!
//! Callers get 20 ms frames of mono `f32` at [`SAMPLE_RATE`], matching what the
//! Opus encoder wants — the same shape the mic path produces, so everything
//! downstream is shared. The device decides its own rate and channel count, so
//! [`downmix_to_mono`] and [`resample_linear`] bridge the gap; both are pure and
//! tested independently of any audio hardware.
//!
//! # Echo hazard
//!
//! Loopback captures *everything* the machine plays, which includes remote
//! peers' voices coming out of the speakers. Sending that back is a feedback
//! loop. Mitigation (excluding our own render stream, ducking, or requiring a
//! virtual cable) belongs with the send path, not here — this module's job is
//! to report what the device is playing, honestly.
