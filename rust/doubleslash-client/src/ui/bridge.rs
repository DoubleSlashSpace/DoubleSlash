//! Qt/QML bridge — the AppBridge QObject singleton that QML binds to.
//!
//! Compiled only when the `qt-ui` Cargo feature is enabled.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//! 1. QML instantiates `AppBridge { id: backend }`.
//! 2. QML calls `backend.initializeBackend()` from `Component.onCompleted`.
//! 3. `initializeBackend` unlocks the identity, opens stores, starts a
//!    multi-thread tokio runtime on a dedicated OS thread, and spawns all
//!    DoubleSlash background tasks there.
//! 4. Background tasks post UI updates back to the Qt thread via
//!    `CxxQtThread::queue`.
//! 5. QML user actions call invokables which `try_send` on tokio channels.
