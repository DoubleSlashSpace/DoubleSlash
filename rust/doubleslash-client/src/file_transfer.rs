//! File-transfer manager.
//!
//! Chunk encoding uses standard base64. Compression + delta are handled by
//! pure-Rust helpers implementing the conquerd transfer protocol.
//!
//! Wire compatibility
//! ------------------
//! * `CHUNK_SIZE` = 65 536 bytes.
//! * Delta format: `b"CDv1"` magic + zlib-compressed opcode stream.
//! * Compression: zlib level 6; only applied when output ≤ 90 % of input and
//!   input ≥ 1 024 bytes.
//! * SHA-256 hex digest of the **original uncompressed** file is the transfer
//!   identifier for integrity.
//!
//! Inline vs. streaming
//! --------------------
//! Files at or below [`INLINE_MAX`] take the original in-RAM path: compressed
//! and/or delta-encoded, chunked from a `Vec<u8>`, reassembled from a chunk map.
//!
//! Larger files (up to [`MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE`]) stream: the sender reads
//! [`CHUNK_SIZE`] at a time from the source file on demand, and the receiver
//! writes each chunk straight into a sparse `.part` file at its own offset,
//! so neither side ever holds the whole payload.
//!
//! **Streaming transfers are never compressed or delta-encoded.** That is not
//! an optimisation choice — it is what makes `payload_len == size`, and hence
//! what makes "chunk `i` lives at byte offset `i * CHUNK_SIZE`" true. Fixed
//! offsets are the only reason a receiver can write chunks out of order without
//! buffering them. Do not add compression to the streaming path without also
//! replacing the offset calculation.
