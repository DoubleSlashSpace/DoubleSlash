//! Content-audio capture → encode → send loop.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::video::sender`]: a dedicated OS thread, because both halves
//! block. The loopback endpoint waits on the device and the Opus call is
//! CPU-bound, so parking a tokio worker on either would stall unrelated
//! futures — the voice pipeline included, which is the one thing this feature
//! must never disturb.
//!
//! # Timestamps come from the device, not from a clock read
//!
//! The obvious implementation reads the session clock once per frame. It is
//! wrong here, and visibly so: a loopback endpoint hands back whatever is in
//! its buffer, so one device read routinely yields several 20 ms frames at
//! once. Stamping each with "now" would give three frames captured 60 ms apart
//! near-identical timestamps, and a receiver extrapolating from them would
//! conclude the stream had stalled and then jumped.
//!
//! So the clock is read **once**, to anchor the stream, and each frame is
//! anchor + the offset the capture device reports for it (see
//! [`ContentFrame::offset_us`](crate::content_capture::ContentFrame::offset_us)).
//!
//! The near-miss worth naming is counting frames instead — anchor + n x 20 ms.
//! It is right for as long as the device produces audio continuously, and a
//! loopback device does not: an application that is not playing anything
//! produces no packets at all. Counting therefore resumes after a silence as
//! though no time had passed, so every pause pushes the audio further behind
//! the video for the rest of the session. Asking the device costs nothing and
//! skips the gap exactly.
//!
//! Long-run drift between the device clock and the session clock is real and
//! deliberately not corrected in v1; at the tens-of-minutes scale a call runs,
//! it stays far inside the +/-40-80 ms sync target.
