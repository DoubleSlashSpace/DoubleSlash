//! Picture-in-picture: several capture sources drawn into one frame.
//!
//! # Why compose rather than send two streams
//!
//! A video fragment identifies its stream by sender peer id alone (see
//! [`super::fragment`]), so one peer cannot have two concurrent video streams
//! without a header change — and a second stream would double the bitrate of the
//! largest flow on the link. Compositing sidesteps both: the sources are merged
//! into one frame *before* the encoder, so the wire format, the receivers, and
//! the bandwidth budget are all unchanged. A peer running camera-over-game looks
//! exactly like a peer sharing one source.
//!
//! ```text
//! base source ─────────────────┐
//!                              ├─ compose ─> encode ─> seal ─> fragment
//! overlay source(s) ─ (thread) ┘
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the overlays get their own threads
//!
//! Capture backends block: `IMFSourceReader::ReadSample` waits on the camera.
//! Pulling each source in turn on the capture thread would make the output frame
//! rate the *sum* of every source's latency — two 30 fps cameras would compose
//! at 15 fps — and one stalled source would freeze the whole outgoing stream.
//! Each overlay therefore runs its own capture loop and publishes its newest
//! frame into a slot the compositor samples. The base source alone paces the
//! output, an overlay that is slow simply repeats, and an overlay that dies
//! leaves the rest of the picture running.
