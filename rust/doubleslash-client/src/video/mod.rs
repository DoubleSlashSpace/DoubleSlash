//! Video capture, encoding, transport framing, and decode.
//!
//! The pipeline mirrors the audio one in [`crate::call_controller`], with one
//! structural difference: an encoded video frame does not fit a single QUIC
//! datagram, so [`fragment`] sits between the codec and the transport on both
//! ends.
//!
//! ```text
//! camera -> encode -> seal (whole frame) -> fragment -> datagrams
//! datagrams -> reassemble -> verify signature -> open seal -> decode -> QVideoSink
//! ```
//!
//! "Camera" there may be several devices at once: a fragment names its stream by
//! sender alone, so a peer gets exactly one video stream, and picture-in-picture
//! is therefore done by merging sources into one frame before the encoder. See
//! [`composite`].
//!
//! Sealing happens once per frame rather than per fragment: a partial frame
//! cannot be decoded, so per-fragment sealing would cost 28 bytes and a GCM
//! operation each for no gain. Authenticity likewise rides one Ed25519
//! signature per frame, carried on fragment 0 — see [`fragment`] for why the
//! signed-JSON envelope used by room audio is not viable at video frame rates.
