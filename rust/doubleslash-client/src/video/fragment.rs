//! Video frame fragmentation and reassembly over unreliable datagrams.
//!
//! Audio never needed this: one 20 ms Opus frame always fits inside a single
//! 1200-byte datagram, so `send_audio_datagram` can put a whole frame on the
//! wire untouched. A video frame does not — an inter frame runs a few KB and a
//! keyframe tens of KB, in every codec we support — and the relay silently
//! *drops* any datagram over `MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE`. So the sender splits each
//! encoded frame into fragments and the receiver puts them back together.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! This module owns everything *after* the channel tag; the transport prepends
//! [`VIDEO_TAG`](doubleslash_features::channel_frame::VIDEO_TAG) or
//! [`ROOM_VIDEO_TAG`](doubleslash_features::channel_frame::ROOM_VIDEO_TAG) exactly
//! as `encode_frame` does for the other channels.
//!
//! ```text
//! [ver:u8]                  0x03
//! [flags:u8]                bit0 keyframe · bit1 has_signature · bits2-7 reserved
//! [codec:u8]                VideoCodec wire byte

//!
//! # Why the codec is on every frame
//!
//! Peers negotiate a codec from their advertised sets (see
//! [`doubleslash_features::video_codec`]), but negotiation alone is not enough to
//! decode by. A room sender fans out to every member at once and there may be
//! no single codec all of them run, so "what did we agree on" is not a
//! well-defined question room-side — only "what is *this* frame" is. Carrying
//! the codec makes the receiver's decoder choice a fact rather than an
//! inference, and lets a member that cannot decode this codec drop the frame
//! and say so instead of feeding a decoder bytes it will choke on.
//!
//! The byte is bound into the frame signature (see
//! [`video_frame_signing_bytes`](super::video_frame_signing_bytes)), so a relay
//! flipping it fails verification rather than silently redirecting a frame to
//! the wrong decoder.
//!
//! # Why not the signed-JSON envelope room audio uses
//!
//! Room audio wraps every frame in a base64'd, Ed25519-signed `SfuAudio` JSON
//! message. That costs ~300 bytes of envelope plus a 1.33x base64 expansion,
//! leaving roughly 644 usable bytes per datagram, and forces the supernode to
//! run a full `serde_json` parse per datagram. At 30 fps with ~4 fragments per
//! frame that is over 120 parses and signature verifications per second per
//! sender. The binary header above is ~64 bytes before the signature (12-byte
//! fixed prefix including `pts_us`, ~44-byte sender, 8-byte seq/frag fields),
//! leaving ~1134 usable bytes — about 76% more goods per datagram — and the
//! relay forwards it opaquely.
//!
//! # Authenticity
//!
//! Dropping the JSON envelope drops its per-message signature, and the group
//! key is *shared* (see [`crate::group_key`]), so GCM alone cannot tell one
//! room member from another: any member could seal a frame claiming to be a
//! different sender. Authenticity is preserved by signing **once per frame**
//! rather than once per datagram, with the signature riding fragment 0. The
//! receiver verifies after reassembly and before opening the GCM seal.
//!
//! This module is deliberately pure — no I/O, no clock of its own (callers
//! pass `now`) — because it is the piece most exposed to hostile input.
