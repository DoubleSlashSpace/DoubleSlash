//! Connection manager — signaling, QUIC transport, and invite handshake.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - One [`ConnectionManager`] per session, owned by the application.
//! - An async `tokio::task` drives the WebSocket signaling loop.
//! - A `quinn::Endpoint` handles peer-to-peer QUIC connections.
//! - `mpsc` channels carry inbound events to the application layer.
//!
//! The manager itself is split under [`manager`]: routing, inbound dispatch,
//! room/group-key sessions, direct peer QUIC, and invite handshake — still one
//! type and one `run_inner` loop.
