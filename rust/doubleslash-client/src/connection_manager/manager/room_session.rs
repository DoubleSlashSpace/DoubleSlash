    //! The unkeyed-member strand and its way out.

    //! A member that restarts loses its in-memory epochs while never leaving the
    //! room's cluster-wide membership union. The keyer distributes on join/leave
    //! *edges* and on frames sealed under an old epoch, and a restarted member
    //! produces neither — it cannot even send, because every room send fails
    //! closed without a key. These tests pin the request that breaks the
    //! deadlock, and the authorization that keeps it from being a key oracle.
