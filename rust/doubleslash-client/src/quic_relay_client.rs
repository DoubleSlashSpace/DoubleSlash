//! Native Rust QUIC relay client (slim).
//!
//! Connects to a supernode's QUIC relay listener over mTLS using the
//! caller's Ed25519 identity. The relay grants access based on the
//! certificate CN (peer_id) — no explicit ticket payload is sent on the
//! wire; the ticket is validated client-side only (expiry / host / port).
//!
//! This client is used by:
//!   * [`crate::web_app_client`] — to open a bidirectional QUIC stream
//!     tagged `web.host.app.v1` and fetch in-app portal assets.
//!   * Room voice (`room.audio.sfu`) — to send/receive Opus frames as
//!     unreliable QUIC datagrams instead of base64/JSON over the WebSocket
//!     signaling channel. Datagrams avoid TCP head-of-line blocking, which
//!     is the dominant source of room-audio latency on the WS path. The
//!     frames stay **end-to-end signed** (the datagram carries the same
//!     signed `SfuAudio` JSON the WS path sends), so the receiver verifies
//!     the sender's Ed25519 signature exactly as before — the supernode
//!     remains a dumb forwarder that cannot forge a member's voice.
//!
//! Wire format reused for relay command stream draining (best-effort,
//! discarded): supernode pushes length-prefixed JSON frames via
//! `conn.open_uni()` (welcome, peer_joined, peer_left, relay_punch).
//! See `rust/doubleslash-supernode/src/wire.rs::encode_relay_cmd`.
//!
//! Room-audio datagram wire shape (sent by us → relay → fanned to members):
//!   * outbound: `[BROADCAST_INDEX][ROOM_AUDIO_TAG][signed SfuAudio JSON]`
//!   * inbound (forwarded by relay): `[sender_index][ROOM_AUDIO_TAG][signed
//!     SfuAudio JSON]`. We ignore `sender_index` — the signed JSON is
//!     self-describing (`msg.sender`) — and hand the JSON to the connection
//!     manager, which verifies + dispatches it on the normal inbound path.
