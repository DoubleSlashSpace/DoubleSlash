//! Group keying for end-to-end encrypted room traffic.
//!
//! This module defines the [`GroupKeySource`] trait — the read seam the codec
//! consumes — and [`SenderKeysGroup`], the **sender-keys** group keying that
//! backs it: a room's elected keyer (see `connection_manager::manager` —
//! deterministically the lexicographically smallest member `public_id`
//! currently present, not necessarily whoever created the room) generates a
//! per-epoch key and seals it to each member 1:1 (the `SfuGroupKey` path), and
//! rekeys on member removal for forward secrecy / post-compromise security.
//! Any member holding real key material can reseal it to a newcomer, so a
//! joiner reliably receives the current epoch on any join path — including
//! the built-in `default` room, which has no client-side creator at all (see
//! `backlog.md` "Crypto — group key reliability"). Until real key material has
//! been generated or received for a conversation, [`Self`] transparently falls
//! back to a deterministic per-room key (every member can derive it locally,
//! at the cost of zero confidentiality vs. the relay) so audio/chat/file keep
//! working during that gap. TreeKEM was considered as a future O(log N)
//! upgrade behind this same trait and declined (see `backlog.md` — invite-only
//! rooms don't hit the O(N) rekey cost that would justify it); this is the
//! long-term keying scheme, not an interim one.
//!
//! Two wire codecs share the epoch key:
//!
//! * **Voice** — each Opus frame is wrapped before the datagram path as
//!   `[epoch:u8][nonce:12][AES-256-GCM(opus)]`, `AAD = conv_id ‖ sender ‖
//!   sequence`, carried in the `ROOM_AUDIO_TAG` (0x04) `SfuAudio` envelope
//!   (`epoch` rides the frame, `sequence` rides the signed envelope as `seq`).
//! * **Room text chat** — the `SfuChat` `body` is sealed as
//!   `nonce ‖ AES-256-GCM(body)`, `AAD = conv_id ‖ sender ‖ message_id`, with
//!   `epoch` on the envelope.
//! * **Room file transfer** — each `SfuFileChunk` `data` field is sealed as
//!   `nonce ‖ AES-256-GCM(data)`, `AAD = conv_id ‖ sender ‖ transfer_id ‖
//!   chunk_index`, with `epoch` on the envelope. `SfuFileOffer` / `SfuFileComplete`
//!   metadata (size, sha256, rel_path) stays cleartext — only the chunk bytes
//!   need sealing to close the SFU content-opacity gap.
//!
//! The relay stays a dumb forwarder — it never sees the key or the plaintext.
