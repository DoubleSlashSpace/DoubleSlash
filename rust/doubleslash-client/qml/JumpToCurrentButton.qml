/*!
    A "jump to current" affordance for a chat \l ListView.

    Appears once the view has been scrolled far enough from the newest message
    that an arriving message would land unseen below the fold, and returns to
    the latest message when clicked.

    Purely an affordance: the panel decides for itself whether to keep
    auto-scrolling. This only reports that the reader has scrolled away and
    offers a way back, so reading history is never interrupted by a message
    yanking the view down.

    The caller anchors it — normally bottom-centre over the list — because only
    the caller knows what else is competing for that corner.

        does not flash a button at you.
