// Rust -> QML video frame delivery.
//
// QML's `VideoOutput` exposes a read-only `videoSink` property, so a sink
// cannot be assigned from QML or from Rust. The only workable direction is the
// one this registry implements: QML hands its sink to C++, keyed by peer id,
// and the decode thread pushes frames in.
//
// Everything crossing the cxx-qt boundary is a QString or a scalar, so the
// pixel path deliberately does not go through it — the plain `extern "C"`
// functions below take raw plane pointers instead.
